Visual Prompt Studio Phase 1.1

Prompt:
Make a painting of a young man standing alone on a rooftop during sunset. The sky should have orange and purple colors. The city should look lighter and a little blurry in the background to show depth. Make the man darker than the sky so he stands out more. The mood should feel a little lonely but also hopeful.

Vocabulary:
Value: The lightness and darkness in an image.
Depth: The feeling of space in a picture.
Focal point: The main area that attracts attention first.
Contrast: The difference between light and dark areas.

Reflection:
I created depth by making the city in the background lighter and blurry. This makes it look far away.
The focal point is the man on the rooftop. It is created by making him darker than the bright sky behind him.
The warm colors create a calm but lonely mood, showing isolation and hope.
